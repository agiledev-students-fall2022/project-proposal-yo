# MUSAIK

beautiful noise

## What and why?

What software system would you like to build this semester, and why? Include a description of what problem the system would solve and why this is important.

New music discovery is a souless, intensive experience. If you want to find new artists, you'll have to sift through playlist on top of playlist for hours. Musaik will connect users through streaming parties and auto-match chats. Users will discover new music easily and enjoyably.

## For whom?

Who will this software be for? These people are your end-users or customers.

Do not make software for imaginary users who do not exist - you must have real people as your initial end-users. Tell us who they are. For example, is it for a particular type of business, mass consumer, a campus office, a professor, or friends or family, or ... people just like you.

Understanding who your end-users are, and ideally speaking with some along the way, will help you refine your designs to be suitable for your audience, and understand whether you have succeeded at the end or not.

Musaik is for individuals with a streaming account--Spotify, Apple Music. Users will be a mix of music nerds and casual listeners

## How?

Users can discover stations


⁃ Auto visual/video

⁃ Anyone can start a temporary station

⁃ analyze users’ preferences

⁃ Present current stations by popularity and taste (a "feed" but more engaging)

⁃ Current song is played for all users on station

⁃ Songs distributed to users live through their streaming account

⁃ NO LIVE CHAT AND NO VOICEOVER

⁃ Station host can preload or live video feed


Users can view and share their listening stats 


- top artists, songs, albums, etc.


Users can make friends and chat


⁃ Match by preference

⁃ Chat with friend/friend


## Scope

It's not a rocketship, but there's a lot of meat to handle. It requires implementing chat functions, authentication with external APIs, UI/UX design, matching and recommendations, data storage.
