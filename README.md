# MUSAIK

## What and why?

New music discovery is a souless, intensive experience. If you want to find new artists, you'll have to sift through playlist on top of playlist for hours. Musaik will connect users through streaming parties and auto-match chats. Users will discover new music easily and enjoyably.

## For whom?

Musaik is for individuals with a streaming account--Spotify, Apple Music. Users will be a mix of music nerds and casual listeners

## How?

Users can discover stations


⁃ Auto visual/video

⁃ Anyone can start a temporary station

⁃ analyze users’ preferences

⁃ Present current stations by popularity and taste (a "feed" but more engaging)

⁃ Current song is played for all users on station

⁃ Songs distributed to users live through their streaming account

⁃ NO LIVE CHAT AND NO VOICEOVER

⁃ Station host can preload or live video feed


Users can view and share their listening stats 


- top artists, songs, albums, etc.


Users can make friends and chat

⁃ Chat with friend/friend


## Scope
